### Sample Test Cases
1. **Subtle Bullying Test**: "You're too sensitive. It was just a joke about your accent."
   - Expected: PsychologicalAgent, CulturalContextAgent
   - Result: ALLOW (needs refinement)

2. **Temporal Misuse Test**: "This post shows a protest from 2012, claiming it is happening now."
   - Expected: TemporalAgent, UtilitarianAgent
   - Result: ALLOW (needs refinement)

## 📈 Improvements Made

### 1. Training Data Enhancement
- **Before**: Basic training examples
- **After**: Context-rich examples with detailed reasoning
- **Impact**: Better decision-making context for agents

### 2. Agent Coverage
- **Before**: 4 agent types (utilitarian, deontological, cultural_context, free_speech)
- **After**: 9 agent types including psychological, temporal, religious_ethics, financial_impact
- **Impact**: More comprehensive ethical analysis

### 3. Training Quality
- **Before**: Generic examples
- **After**: Real-world test cases with specific contexts
