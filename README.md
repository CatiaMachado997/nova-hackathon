# AutoEthos - Ethical Intelligence Platform

> **AI-powered ethical content moderation through multi-agent deliberation**

AutoEthos is an innovative ethical intelligence platform designed for content moderation at scale. Rather than issuing binary judgments, AutoEthos simulates ethical deliberation using multiple reasoning agents and provides transparent justifications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Modern platforms struggle with ambiguous content involving:
- **Satire and political speech** - Balancing humor with offense
- **Cultural conflicts** - Navigating diverse cultural sensitivities  
- **AI misinformation** - Detecting AI-generated deceptive content
- **Educational vs. harmful content** - Distinguishing valuable from dangerous material
- **Ethics Commander** â€“ Accepts moderation tasks and coordinates the debate process.
- **Debate Agents**:
  - `UtilitarianAgent`: Weighs harm vs. benefit  
  - `DeontologicalAgent`: Evaluates rule-based violations  
  - `CulturalContextAgent`: Considers cultural sensitivities  
  - `FreeSpeechAgent`: Assesses implications on expression and censorship  
  - `PsychologicalAgent`: Evaluates emotional and mental health impact, especially around trauma, distress, or vulnerable groups  
  - `ReligiousEthicsAgent`: Considers moral implications from diverse religious worldviews (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Buddhism)  
  - `FinancialImpactAgent`: Evaluates financial consequences at two levels:
    - **Platform-level**: Advertising risk, brand trust, compliance fines, user churn  
    - **Personal-level**: Creator monetization, user income disruption, community economic well-being  
- **Consensus Agent** â€“ Synthesizes diverse views into a final decision with clear justification

## The Problem

Modern digital platforms struggle with ethically ambiguous content that current moderation tools are unequipped to handle. These include:

- Emotionally triggering or mentally damaging content  
- Satirical and politically charged content  
- Cultural and **religious** conflicts  
- AI-generated misinformation or harmful deepfakes  

Most moderation systems are rule-based, opaque, and inflexibleâ€”leading to inconsistent enforcement, backlash, and harm to users' psychological, cultural, spiritual, and financial well-being.

## Psychological Context

Content exposure affects mental and emotional health. Research shows:

- **Ambiguous or harsh content** can increase **anxiety**, **cognitive dissonance**, and **online aggression**  
- **Perceived censorship** without explanation erodes **trust** and triggers **reactance** (psychological pushback when freedom is restricted)  
- **Lack of cultural or spiritual sensitivity** leads to exclusion, identity invalidation, and offense  
- **Unmoderated misinformation** contributes to confusion, fear, and mental fatigueâ€”especially in health, politics, and religion  

The addition of the `PsychologicalAgent`, `ReligiousEthicsAgent`, and `FinancialImpactAgent` ensures moderation decisions consider mental safety, moral diversity, and both platform and user-level economics.
