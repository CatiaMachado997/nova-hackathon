# EthIQ – Ethical Intelligence for Content Moderation  
*“It’s not just moderation. It’s the future of ethical intelligence.”*

## Overview

**EthIQ** is an AI-powered ethical moderation system designed to handle complex and sensitive content decisions with depth, transparency, and nuance. Rather than issuing binary judgments, EthIQ simulates ethical deliberation using multiple reasoning agents that represent diverse moral perspectives.

### How It Works

A modular multi-agent system enables dynamic ethical reasoning:

- **Ethics Commander** – Accepts moderation tasks and coordinates the debate process.
- **Debate Agents**:
  - `UtilitarianAgent`: Weighs harm vs. benefit  
  - `DeontologicalAgent`: Evaluates rule-based violations  
  - `CulturalContextAgent`: Considers cultural sensitivities  
  - `FreeSpeechAgent`: Assesses implications on expression and censorship  
  - `PsychologicalAgent`: Evaluates emotional and mental health impact, especially around trauma, distress, or vulnerable groups  
  - `ReligiousEthicsAgent`: Considers moral implications from diverse religious worldviews (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Buddhism)  
  - `FinancialImpactAgent`: Evaluates financial consequences at two levels:
    - **Platform-level**: Advertising risk, brand trust, compliance fines, user churn  
    - **Personal-level**: Creator monetization, user income disruption, community economic well-being  
- **Consensus Agent** – Synthesizes diverse views into a final decision with clear justification

## The Problem

Modern digital platforms struggle with ethically ambiguous content that current moderation tools are unequipped to handle. These include:

- Emotionally triggering or mentally damaging content  
- Satirical and politically charged content  
- Cultural and **religious** conflicts  
- AI-generated misinformation or harmful deepfakes  

Most moderation systems are rule-based, opaque, and inflexible—leading to inconsistent enforcement, backlash, and harm to users' psychological, cultural, spiritual, and financial well-being.

## Psychological Context

Content exposure affects mental and emotional health. Research shows:

- **Ambiguous or harsh content** can increase **anxiety**, **cognitive dissonance**, and **online aggression**  
- **Perceived censorship** without explanation erodes **trust** and triggers **reactance** (psychological pushback when freedom is restricted)  
- **Lack of cultural or spiritual sensitivity** leads to exclusion, identity invalidation, and offense  
- **Unmoderated misinformation** contributes to confusion, fear, and mental fatigue—especially in health, politics, and religion  

The addition of the `PsychologicalAgent`, `ReligiousEthicsAgent`, and `FinancialImpactAgent` ensures moderation decisions consider mental safety, moral diversity, and both platform and user-level economics.
