# EthIQ – Ethical Intelligence for Content Moderation  
*“It’s not just moderation. It’s ethical intelligence.”*

## Overview

**EthIQ** is an AI-powered ethical moderation system designed to handle complex and sensitive content decisions with depth, transparency, and nuance. Rather than issuing binary judgments, EthIQ simulates ethical deliberation using multiple reasoning agents that represent diverse moral perspectives.

### How It Works

A modular multi-agent system enables dynamic ethical reasoning:

- **Ethics Commander** – Accepts moderation tasks and coordinates the debate process.
- **Debate Agents**:
  - `UtilitarianAgent`: Weighs harm vs. benefit.
  - `DeontologicalAgent`: Evaluates rule-based violations.
  - `CulturalContextAgent`: Considers cultural sensitivities.
  - `FreeSpeechAgent`: Assesses implications on expression and censorship.
- **Consensus Agent** – Synthesizes diverse views into a final decision with clear justification.
- **Audit Logger (Bonus)** – Streams logs to Notion and moderation metrics to Cloudera.

## The Problem

Modern digital platforms struggle with ethically ambiguous content that current moderation tools are unequipped to handle. These include:

 
- Emotionally triggering or mentally damaging content  
- Satirical and politically charged content  
- Cultural and religious conflicts  
- AI-generated misinformation or harmful deepfakes 

Most moderation systems are rule-based, opaque, and inflexible—leading to inconsistent enforcement, backlash, and harm to users' psychological well-being.

## Psychological Context

Content exposure affects mental and emotional health. Research shows:

- **Ambiguous or harsh content** can increase **anxiety**, **cognitive dissonance**, and **online aggression**.  
- **Perceived censorship** without explanation erodes **trust** and triggers **reactance** (psychological pushback when freedom is restricted).  
- **Lack of cultural/contextual understanding** leads to feelings of exclusion and identity invalidation.  
- **Unmoderated misinformation** contributes to confusion, fear, and mental fatigue—especially in health, politics, and crisis-related content.  

EthIQ addresses these challenges by simulating ethical deliberation and producing explainable moderation outcomes that prioritize psychological and cultural sensitivity.
